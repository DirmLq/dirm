                    into the book with a pen.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>DO NOT REWRITE THE QUESTIONS</b> into the book, rather, use the selection
                    of stickers included into this kit to denote which question you will be 
                    answering. Each sticker corresponds to a question, check the chart below.
                    <br><br>
                    Place these stickers at the top of the page before you start writing. 
                    Place as many stickers as you want or to as many as you relate to. Be as 
                    expressive and in-depth as you can based on your own personal experience. 
                    Be minddful that there is a limited amount of spaace in the book.
                    <br><br>

                    stains, etc., that best relfelct what you want to covey your experience on top
