                <h4>Although the East River Tunnels primarily served passenger traffic, freight traffic to industries in New York arrived in one of two ways: 
                    through already established rail connections to the mainland, or by barge onto gantries. Both methods still remain intact to the present day, 
                    with mainland connections available at multiple locations throughout the City and barges in Brooklyn are still active. Gantry cranes in 
                    Long Island City and a few others scattered all over the City exist as remnants of New York’s historical industrial past.

                <h4>With the Interstate Highway Act of 1956 and under Robert Moses' control of NYC, emphasis on the road networks increased, sidelining railroads 
                    and putting them out of business. The railroad industry subsequently declined to a point where freight via railroads were non-existent for 
                    some industries and relied primarily on trucks for freight. Street level tracks were ripped up in order to provide smooth asphalt for trucks, 
                    thus decreasing the freight network in the City substantially.

                <h4>Revitalization of these railroads look different at every application. While Long Island City’s barges are inactive, yet integrated into the 
                    post-industrial heritage of Gantry State Park, the High Line transformed into a jungle in its own right. Railroads, whether it be passenger or 
                    freight, will continue to impact New York’s economy for the foreseeable future.
